What Even Is Security

Or WEIS for short, is a project I will be working on to improve the security of my computer

This is for any old usb stick to be the center of your security, making your new issue not losing the physical key instead of remembering your password.

This is to prevent someone just coming in to my room, sitting on my chair, and using my computer as they please without my permission

I will be making this for my computers on windows and linux as a personal project for fun and not any real reason

## what the hell i dont trust you
Fair, I dont expect you to trust some guy on the internet what is a good security call, but I will be posting my source code so you can check everything you like to make sure its up to your standards before using it :)
